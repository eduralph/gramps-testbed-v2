        Gramps emits startup warnings (GExiv2 missing, GTK translations missing,

        ``dialog`` or ``alert`` in AT-SPI. Leaving them up blocks the main loop,
        so ``gramps -O <tree>`` never actually opens the tree.

        Two button-set categories are handled:
          * generic dismissal — ``Close`` / ``OK`` / ``Cancel`` — for
            informational warnings (e.g. "GExiv2 not available").

    """Base class for an ADDON's end-to-end GUI test (the "addon E2E" convention).

    Ship these in the addon's own repo at ``<Addon>/tests/interface/test_*.py`` and run
    them with ``engine/scripts/ubuntu/run-addon-interface.sh <Addon>`` (or the
    ``T3-addon-interface`` gate). The runner installs ``<Addon>`` into the launched
    gramps' ``USER_PLUGINS`` and puts the testbed's ``engine/`` on ``PYTHONPATH``, so the
    addon test imports the harness portably:

        from interface.base import AddonInterfaceTestCase

        class MyAddonView(AddonInterfaceTestCase):
            ADDON = "MyAddon"           # documents which addon is under test (installed
                                        # by the runner; informational here)
            TREE_NAME = "MyAddonTree"   # a tree seeded from
                                        # <Addon>/tests/interface/data/MyAddonTree.gramps,
                                        # else the default "TestTree" example fixture

            def test_view_opens(self):
                btn = self.app.child(name="My Addon", roleName="toggle button")
                btn.click()
                ...

    Everything else (headless launch, AT-SPI wait, dialog dismissal, screenshot +
    tree-dump on failure) is inherited from ``GrampsInterfaceTestCase``. This subclass
    adds only the ``ADDON`` marker and this contract — so an addon's frontend behaviour
    is verified *inside* a real gramps, the E2E-with-core a GUI-facing addon needs.
